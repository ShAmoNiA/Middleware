# Middleware
This middleware is designed to run as a server between a real server and a customer using Python and the Flask web framework. It intercepts incoming requests from customers, modifies them (if necessary), forwards them to the real server, receives the response, modifies it (if necessary), and returns it to the customer.

## Installation
To install the middleware, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd your-repo-name
```
Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
To use the middleware, follow these steps:

Open middleware.py in your favorite code editor.

Modify the code to add your own middleware logic before and after forwarding the request to the real server. You can perform tasks such as authentication, logging, rate limiting, or modifying the request or response.

Run the middleware:

```
python middleware.py
```
Send requests to the middleware at http://localhost:5000/. The middleware will forward the requests to the real server and return the responses to the customer.

## Threading
This middleware uses threading to handle multiple requests concurrently. By default, the middleware creates a pool of 5 worker threads to handle requests. You can adjust the number of threads by modifying the following line in middleware.py:

```
for i in range(5):
```
Change 5 to the number of threads you want to use.
